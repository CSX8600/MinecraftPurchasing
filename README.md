# Minecraft Purchasing
Minecraft Purchasing a system that allows you to create Purchase Orders to different establishments throughout your Minecraft world.  While the system doesn't actually do anything in game, it does provide a nicer tracking system over using Microsoft Excel.

The system also allows you to create HTTP streams from OpenComputers to this service to emulate "network printing" of train lists and bills of lading.
